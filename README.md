An Ultimate Small Proactor Network Library in C++03
==================================================
1. Mnet is extreamly small C++ library, 2 files only
2. Mnet designed with a proactor pattern and uses a customized buffer design to avoid copy
3. To work with it, 4 classes are needed to know .
4. Mnet policy based template trick to avoid inheritance, in a word , no inhertiance at all
5. Epoll based reactor, only support Linux and I have no reason to port it to other platform :)
